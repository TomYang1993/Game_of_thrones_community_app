Read her words below.</p><h3><strong>Ahmed </strong></h3><p>by Lena Headey</p><p><em>Today I spent time with a man who, had I been born 20 years earlier in Palestine, I would have fallen in love with.</em></p><p><em>Standing here today in Cherso camp on the Greek mainland as part of a trip organized by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), I <strong>do</strong> fall in love with Ahmed.</em></p><p><em>His home is a one man green tent and as this is the Greek summer it's insanely hot. His wife was killed in the war and he is trying to get to his sons who are now in Holland.</em></p><p><em>I believe he is being \"fast tracked.\" I'm sadly beginning to think this process doesn't exist.&nbsp; Perhaps it does but should have a new name –“too slow, too little resources track”.</em></p><p><em>He is beautifully turned out. A still handsome man who mourns for the sad changes in his country. I felt like our chests were wide open and our hearts embraced as we stood under the blue umbrella which shaded us from the blazing sun. He took my head in his hands and kissed the top of it, telling me he only kisses his children this way. He told me my face was calm and made him feel peaceful. At which point my tears fell and I embraced him as any of us would with someone we love.</em></p><p><em>Ahmed's dignity, kindness and still tangible joy is astonishing considering his story. These people here are angry, yes. They have lost everything. Not just a favorite jumper or a favorite ring. EVERYTHING is gone.&nbsp; And yet there is a connection happening. Human to human contact on the most raw heart-exploding level. We are missing this in the West. We think if we have EVERYTHING we are truly happy. NOT the case.</em></p><p><em>I defy anyone to come here and meet the refugees and their children and not discover the depth of your own humanity.&nbsp; They will welcome you and your interest in them. You will feel like you've discovered the rest of your tribe. And a few of you will feel like you've come home.</em></p><p><em>While at Cherso, we watched a play that one of the girls had written about the war in her homeland of Syria. Haya had arrived at the camp and recruited a boy and 4 other girls. They sang a childhood rhyme accompanied by her mum’s iPhone. They sang and laughed and then pointed to a picture they had drawn of a fighter plane. They then crouched on the ground with their hands over their ears and began to cry.&nbsp; It was one of the most moving things I've ever witnessed. Haya then took the role of mother and pulled the children close.&nbsp; She dusted off their toys and tried to return them but the children were too sad and threw the toys down. This was the end of Haya’s play. It didn't matter I speak not a word of Arabic. We witnessed the horror these kids have lived through and saw first-hand that kids are resilient.</em></p><p><em>The IRC are trying to provide theatre space in camps so everyone can feel they have a space to express their pain. This is a beautiful and necessary thing. Art is freedom.</em></p><p><em>At the end of the play, as kids do, they stood up as we clapped and they smiled and they were proud.</em></p><p><em>I spoke to some of the great and inspiring people of Greece who are carrying out the IRC’s lifesaving work. Young people who are stepping up with a ferocity and a passion that is stirring.</em></p><p><em>Of course they get sad, frustrated and angry, but they all say when one of their guests says THANK YOU, when they have that connection and know they are making a difference, it makes all the frustrations worth it.</em></p><p><em>We had to leave all too suddenly in order to visit another camp. I will be back. I feel like I left my family.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Hear more about the actors' experience in the video below:</p><iframe scrolling=\"no\" data-image-dimensions=\"854x480\" allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/dKwff5UDKEg?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"854\" data-embed=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\">\n</iframe><p>To learn more about how you can help,&nbsp;visit <a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/\">www.rescue.org</a>.</p><p></p>", vote_number: 0, title: "Lena Headey's Message to You About the Refugee Crisis", summary: "Lena Headey, Maisie Williams and Liam Cunningham visited the International \nRescue Committee refugee camps.

The cast has not received scripts yet, which means they are equally in the dark. HBO asked the actors what they’re hoping to see next summer. Here’s what they said:</p><h3><strong>A Cersei/Dany Face-Off</strong></h3><p>“I really just want to see the Cersei/Daenerys face-off,” said Sophie Turner. A fan at the panel asked what fans could expect if the two women meet. “Maybe they’ll just get on really well?” suggested Nathalie Emmanuel. “Like, hey girl?”</p><h3><strong>A Dilemma for Bran</strong></h3><p>When it comes to Bran’s story, Isaac Hempstead Wright had a theory: “Bran’s got this mark from the Night’s King on his arm; it ruined the magic of the cave. I think it might ruin the magic of the Wall. I reckon Bran will have a dilemma about whether or not he goes through the Wall.”</p><h3><strong>Options for Sansa</strong></h3><p>Turner had no idea what was next for Sansa. “There are so many directions she could go,” Turner mused. “She could really embrace the power that she has and go on to be something of a leader alongside Jon. She could be very embittered by the whole thing and try to take Littlefinger’s side. Maybe she’ll have a taste for killing and develop a sadistic side.”</p><h3><strong>A Promise Fulfilled</strong></h3><p>When it comes to Samwell Tarly, “I hope he does what he promises he’s going to do,” said John Bradley. “I want him to go to the Citadel and do something that’s going to have an effect on the greater good. He’s not there for a holiday or easy life. I want him to discover something.”</p><h3><strong>A Safe Landing</strong></h3><p>Emmanuel had one main request: “I hope to see Daenerys in Westeros. We’re heading there. I hope she makes it.”</p><h3><strong>Battle</strong></h3><p>“I’m hoping to see an epic sea battle,” Iwan Rheon declared. “I feel there’s one coming in the cards.” Kristian Nairn also predicted a battle, but between the White Walkers and Westeros. “In my opinion,” Nairn guessed, “the Walkers are going to steamroll the Lannisters, so there’s going to be a huge battle and they’re going to die. I can’t wait.”</p><p>Check out the first Season 7 production tease below and share what you’re hoping to happen in the comments section.</p><iframe scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/pjue5j1JRaA?feature=youtu.be&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"854\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\">\n</iframe><h3><strong>GET MORE SDCC COVERAGE</strong></h3><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li><a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/2016/7/23/the-cast-remembers-gots-dearly-departed\">GoT Cast Remembers the Dearly Depart</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/cosplay-tips-from-the-got-cast\">Cosplay Tips From the GOT Cast and Costume Designer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/cosplay-tips-from-the-got-cast\">13 Talking Points From the Panel</a></li></ul>", vote_number: 0, title: "The GoT’s Cast Season 7 Wishlist", summary: "Now that Season 6 is over, fans at San Diego Comic-Con are speculating \nwhat’s next in Season 7 – and they’re not the only ones.

  {image: nil, content: "<p>Like every year on <em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 6 brought a fair share of death. HBO chatted with the actors at San Diego Comic-Con whose characters passed away last year – including Iwan Rheon, Kristian Nairn and Faye Marsay, who played Ramsay Bolton, Hodor and the Waif, respectively. Read up on the fan responses, souvenirs and surprises of dying on <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p><h3><strong>Getting the News</strong></h3>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"thumb-image\" alt=\"Iwan Rheon at SDCC.\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/5793c0a7d2b857dd709b34de/1469300911726/\" data-image-dimensions=\"2048x1364\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5793c0a7d2b857dd709b34de\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/5793c0a7d2b857dd709b34de/1469300911726/?format=1000w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>Iwan Rheon at SDCC.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n<p>Nairn was surprised to learn of not only of his character’s death, but the meaning of his name. “It’s amazing to me that I’ve known [author] George [RR Martin] now for seven years. I always asked him the origin of Hodor and he never told me. He really is good at foreshadowing and keeping things secret.”</p><p>Rheon found out about Ramsay’s fate nearly a year ago. “I got the phone call from [series creators] David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss]. They were like, ‘Congratulations! Ramsay gets to the Iron Throne.’ At that point, I knew he was dead.”</p><p>Marsay found out at the script read-through. “I was flipping through pages and was like, ahh!”</p><h3><strong>Saying Goodbye</strong></h3><p>Nairn said that his last day on set was also his favorite. “I wrapped right around my fortieth birthday. Isaac was the one who got on the megaphone and said, ‘Kristian Nairn, you’ve wrapped.’ It was quite an emotional moment.”</p><p>At the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/13-talking-points-game-of-thrones-panel-at-sdcc\"><em>Game of Thrones</em> panel</a>, “Battle of the Bastards” director Miguel Sapochnik talked about filming Ramsay’s death: “We spent a long time on that scene. There’s such a wish fulfillment aspect to it.” Sophie Turner explained that although the scene was her favorite, she was very saddened by Ramsay’s death. “I love Iwan so much,” she said. “It’s always the evil ones that are the nicest people in real life.”</p><h3><strong>Souvenirs</strong></h3><p>Rheon received a memento from set: “I was sent the paring knife that I used to cut the apple in the Osha scene. I brought it back to Belfast and forgot to give it back and they didn’t ask for it. It was a spare, so nobody needs it now.”</p><p>Nairn snatched a souvenir as well: “I took a bit of one of the broken doors. I’m going to put it on my wall.”</p>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"thumb-image\" alt=\"Faye Marsay at Comic-Con.\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/5793c0cdc534a514ed12f6d8/1469300947335/\" data-image-dimensions=\"2048x1364\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5793c0cdc534a514ed12f6d8\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/5793c0cdc534a514ed12f6d8/1469300947335/?format=1000w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>Faye Marsay at Comic-Con.</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n<h3><strong>Fan Response</strong></h3><p>Marsay was honored by the strong reactions fans had to the Waif: “People hated her, but they loved her as well. I was really proud of that as an actress. I don’t mind people saying they hated the character – it’s a sign that I’ve done something right.”</p><p>Nairn was surprised at the intensity of fan response. “People were howling like a banshee crying. People genuinely annoyed. Like, ‘You really ruined my day.’ [Laughs.] I love how seriously people take it. It just shows how invested people are in the show and it’s awesome.”</p><h3><strong>Legacy</strong></h3><p>Marsay sees her legacy in Arya’s storyline: “I think the Waif served her purpose for Arya.” Rheon agrees with Sansa that House Bolton will likely disappear: “That tends to be what happens in <em>Game of Thrones</em> because the history is written by the winners. I guess he’ll go down in history as a tyrant. I don’t think he will be extremely remembered unless someone’s pregnant. You never know. I hope she isn’t.”</p><p>“Hodor’s legacy is to work hard,” said Nairn. “Be kind to people and hopefully you won’t end up being slaughtered against a door by a herd of undead.”</p><h3>GET MORE SDCC COVERAGE</h3><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li><a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/got-cast-season-7-wishlist\">GoT Cast Members' Season 7 Wishlist</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/cosplay-tips-from-the-got-cast\">Cosplay Tips From the GoT Cast and Costume Designer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/13-talking-points-game-of-thrones-panel-at-sdcc\">13 Talking Points From the Panel</a></li></ul><p> </p><p></p>", vote_number: 0, title: "The Cast Remembers GoT’s Dearly Departed", summary: "Like every year on Game of Thrones, Season 6 brought a fair share of death. \nHBO chatted with the actors at San Diego Comic-Con whose characters passed \naway last year.

Afterwards, the duo chatted with HBO about their reactions to Season 6, hopes for Season 7 and more. As it turns out, the big-time actors have plenty in common with San Diego Comic-Con attendees. Below are eight things the stars share with their fans.</p>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/579184e046c3c4c2c391a563/1469154538203/\" data-image-dimensions=\"1860x1234\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"579184e046c3c4c2c391a563\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/579184e046c3c4c2c391a563/1469154538203/?format=1000w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n<h3><strong>You Miss Departed Actors</strong></h3><p>“My two dearest acting partners on this show have disappeared at the moment,” said Cunningham of Stannis and Melisandre. Luckily, the actor who plays the Red Priestess has more to look forward to than her on-screen counterpart. “The beautiful Carice [Van Houten] is about to give birth to a baby at the moment in real life,” Cunningham said with a smile.</p><h3><strong>You Theorize</strong></h3><p>While neither actor has seen Season 7 scripts, both have their opinions about what’s coming up. Cunningham voiced concerns for the new King in the North. “I’m not sure that’s going to be a good thing for Jon Snow. The kings don’t do terribly well on our show. They don’t last too long.”</p><h3><strong>You “Ship” Couples</strong></h3><p>When asked for his hopes for Season 7, Cunningham had a specific request. “I really, really hope we might see some sort of romance blossom between Tormund and Brienne. I would so love to see the two of them together!”</p><h3><strong>You Adore Lyanna Mormont</strong></h3><p>“She’s a little star, isn’t she?” Cunningham said of <a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/bella-ramsey-lyanna-mormont?rq=lyanna mormont\">actor Bella Ramsey</a>, who plays the Lady of Bear Island. “She’s incredibly professional and a delight to work with.” When asked about his character’s connection to Lyanna, Cunningham laughed at his new nickname he read online: “They’re calling Davos ‘the little girl whisperer’ as opposed to ‘the horse whisperer.’ ”</p><h3><strong>You Join the Discourse</strong></h3><p>Nairn shared that since Hodor’s demise, he’s been overwhelmed with one question: “Everyone’s been asking: ‘Are you coming back as a White Walker?’ That’s been the new ‘Is Jon Snow alive?’ for me. I’m like,&nbsp;‘I don’t know. Pretty sure I’m dead.’ ”</p><h3><strong>You Love Pop Culture</strong></h3><p>At a hotel he was staying at recently, Nairn noticed an interesting item: “There was a doorstop that had Hodor written on it. I thought my manager put it there to make a joke and he was like, ‘Nope. Wasn’t me.’ &nbsp;It’s crazy. It just shows the effect of pop culture.“</p><h3><strong>You Can’t Wait for Season 7</strong></h3><p>“I’m so excited for Season 7,” said Nairn. “Everyone’s waited for Dany to arrive at King’s Landing with her dragons. It looks like it’s about to happen… Unless a giant squid wraps up all the ships. Who knows? It’s so exciting. I can’t wait.” Cunningham is equally in the dark: “There’s so many open stories. I don’t know what’s coming. I’m dying to find out. “</p><h3><strong>You’re a Big Fan</strong></h3><p>“We’re not just putting the show in front of people and seeing if they like it – we all seem to be part of it,” said Cunningham. “It’s a real ownership for the fans and us. Because it’s such a huge ensemble piece, we are really able to enjoy other people’s work. It’s a real joy. I’m a big of a fan as anyone.”</p><p> </p><p></p>", vote_number: 0, title: "8 Things You Have in Common With Kristian Nairn and Liam Cunningham ", summary: "The actors behind Hodor and Davos Seaworth chatted with HBO, revealing the \nmany things they have in common with their fans.

But even then, he’s so arrogant he believes it’s going to be all right. He’s got that sort of ridiculous self-confidence. Then the door starts breaking, and he starts to realize, 'Right, this is over, so I’m going to go out the way I want to go out.'

But Yunus [Ascott] and Eliza [Higgenbottom] have so much knowledge of the fashion jewelry industry that it gave me the confidence to step over into that area. On my own I think it would have been too much, but with them it was great because we all have quite similar ideas, and we love to develop things as we’re working on them. It was a great partnership.</p><p><strong>HBO: So many of the women on the show have incredible fashion – why was Daenerys the right pick?</strong></p><p><strong>Michele Clapton:</strong> She wears quite spectacular pieces, and they tend to be more sculptural and less period. There’s something about her character that appeals to so many people – men, women, young, old. And I thought the pieces I make for her translate to the aesthetic of modern women. I also quite like that they’re not exclusively for women, men can wear some of these pieces. There are other characters we may later work on, but Yunus and Eliza worked primarily with me on Dany’s pieces in the show, so for many reasons she was a good place to start.</p>\n  \n    \n      \n\n

Clapton:</strong> For the pieces from the show I worked with the story, and how I thought the costumes were moving forward. I’ll have an idea of what I want to do, I’ll draw how I want it to fit, and then Eliza and Yunus and I will meet, and we’ll talk about how we can develop it. What makes it such a joy is that their process is a lot like mine. I agree with drawing first, but once you actually start cutting into the fabric, the costume grows as you make it. And that’s what they do; they’ll carve it in wax, and then they carve it away and hollow it, so it’s a process that we can look at all the way through. Yunus actually made the point, sometimes it’s almost like an accident that works out. So it happens over a period of weeks, and evolves as it’s being made.</p><p><strong>HBO: What sort of statement do you think Dany’s jewelry makes?</strong></p><p><strong>Michele Clapton:</strong> Within Game of Thrones they have to express her mental place. I love that they’re not necessarily pretty, they’re quite sculptural, and they represent something. They’re not decoration for decoration’s sake. They relate to something that’s happening in her life, or to her family, or to her trying to make an impression without having to say it.</p>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"thumb-image\" alt=\"Photo Credit: Michelle Beatty\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/577fca6e20099e34c737cbbe/1467992697202/\" data-image-dimensions=\"480x480\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"577fca6e20099e34c737cbbe\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/577fca6e20099e34c737cbbe/1467992697202/?format=1000w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>Photo Credit:&nbsp;Michelle Beatty</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n<p>When we first see her in the white dress [\"<a href=\"http://gameofthrones.com/game-of-thrones/season-5/episode-9\">The Dance of Dragons</a>\"] with the dragon necklace, she’s in a situation she really doesn’t want to be in, and the dragons show her strength. It was great having the wings because I knew she would ride on the dragon. But then she couldn’t then be walking around with this huge necklace, so we just have a wingless dragon curling around her neck. I loved the idea that the wings are lost, and it’s like she feels lost; she’s grounded. There’s always a thread of a story going through it.</p><p><strong>HBO:</strong> <strong>Are there designs for people who may not be the “Mother of Dragons”?</strong></p><p><strong>Michele Clapton: </strong>We tried to make smaller pieces so you can express your inner-khaleesi without actually having to have a great, big necklace on. There’s some beautiful little pieces; my favorite is a little dragon wrap ring. It’s really subtle, but really nice to wear, and incredibly light, even though it’s sterling silver. I like the cuff we made, because it’s really comfortable, and I love the way it just wraps around the wrist. And the little wing earrings are incredibly elegant. So they stand alone, you don’t think, “Oh why have you got Khaleesi’s jewelry on?” You don’t have to be noisy about the pieces. You can shout about it or whisper it.</p>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"thumb-image\" alt=\"Photo Credit: Michelle Beatty\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/577ecd73197aea0321b60ada/1467927943982/\" data-image-dimensions=\"800x800\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"577ecd73197aea0321b60ada\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/577ecd73197aea0321b60ada/1467927943982/?format=1000w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>Photo Credit:&nbsp;Michelle Beatty</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n<p><strong>HBO: Is the winged-dragon necklace your favorite piece in the collection?</strong></p><p><strong>Michele Clapton:</strong> I do love the movement within it, and the way it could be an amazing statement piece with an evening dress, or worn with something simple like a t-shirt and a black jacket. And I think quite interesting things have come out of it, but it has to be my favorite because it was the inspiration for the whole collection.</p><p><strong>HBO: Do you have a next character in mind already?</strong></p><p><strong>Michele Clapton: </strong>We’ve started planning one thing. This is just the beginning of a great partnership, so we’re very keen to add to it. But it has to come from the show. I wouldn’t design a piece just because I wanted it to be in the range. I’d have to design it for a character in the show, and then think it would work in a contemporary way.</p><p><strong>HBO: What can we look forward to with Season 7?</strong></p><p><strong>Michele Clapton:</strong> It’s really exciting to see the way the characters are developing, and make boards of ideas to see what will be an influence on people; where they are in the story and what happens to them. They’re all moving around a bit, and that’s quite interesting. If before we’ve seen them in one climate, now we may be seeing them in another. That has quite a big impact on how their costumes look. So we’re just in the beginning of the process, but it’s going to be good.</p><p>Pieces now available at the <a href=\"http://store.hbo.com/?v=hbo-mey-jewelry&amp;ecid=PRF-HBO-803542&amp;pa=PRF-HBO-803542\">HBO SHOP</a>, or visit <a href=\"https://www.mey.london/product-category/game-of-thrones-2016/\">MEY Designs</a> for more from the Daenerys collection.</p>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"thumb-image\" alt=\"MEY Designs: Michele Clapton, Eliza Higgenbottom, Yunus Ascott Photo Credit: Russell Ferguson\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/577d77cbe6f2e1347cb6cf22/1467840489896/\" data-image-dimensions=\"5472x3648\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"577d77cbe6f2e1347cb6cf22\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/577d77cbe6f2e1347cb6cf22/1467840489896/?format=1000w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>MEY Designs: Michele Clapton, Eliza Higgenbottom, Yunus Ascott</p><p>Photo Credit:&nbsp;Russell Ferguson</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n<p></p>", vote_number: 0, title: "Get Daenerys' Amazing Jewelry and Do as Queens Do", summary: "With 23 Emmy nominations, Game of Thrones is the most-recognized program of \n2016.

I read the King’s Landing scenes so I know what’s going on in the capital, but I purposely chose not to read other storylines. I watched Season 1 as a fan, and in the last few years I’ve really tried to go back to that feeling – on Sunday night I have the most amazing experience like every other audience member.</p><p><strong>HBO: Was there any storyline that you were not expecting?</strong></p><p><strong>Natalie Dormer:</strong> I’m just so relieved that we finally got Jon Snow’s maternity out, because I’ve had that theory for a long time. Sophie [Turner, who plays Sansa Stark] and I were close for a number of years, and I love watching her complex, dramatic growth as Sansa becomes this woman who can play the game herself. When the Knights of the Vale rode over that hill in Episode 9, I was whooping and jumping up and down on the sofa. Also, Rory McCann is a great guy, so the Hound coming back was such a joy to see.</p><p><strong>HBO: What was the most challenging aspect of playing Margaery?</strong></p><p><strong>Natalie Dormer: </strong>Trying to play a character so finely-nuanced that people believe you can be a good person who is also politically savvy. It’s easier to play a nihilistic person or a baddie; you have to get your hands dirty and have real talent, as Jack Gleeson [Joffrey Baratheon] proved, but it’s a simpler task to play a straight psychopath. The thing I wanted to communicate with Margaery is that good people can, hopefully, be in positions of power. I think that’s quite pertinent. I’ve tried to make her a plausibly real, sensitive, good human being with the skills of a good leader.</p><p><strong>HBO: Is there any truth to Margaery’s line to Tommen: “I’ve had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good?”</strong></p><p><strong>Natalie Dormer: </strong>I think she’s articulating out loud something she’s always known about herself. If any of us were forced to sit in a dark cell on our own, we would do some soul searching. But I’ve always held firm that Margaery’s heart is true – I don’t think she has a dark spirit. She’s giving a narrative to Tommen that helps convert him at that moment. Maybe she was able to mix a bit of the truth in there – that’s the most effective kind of lying isn’t it?</p><p><strong>HBO: Are you satisfied with how her story ended?</strong></p><p><strong>Natalie Dormer:</strong> I give [series creators] Dan [Weiss] and David [Benioff] a lot of credit for the choices they made. They had to tie a lot of things up and move the whole King’s Landing story forward, and obviously the whole religious coup was such a complex thing to grapple with. I loved that Margaery’s demise was not at Cersei’s hand, but at the hand of someone else underestimating Cersei when Margaery wasn’t in a position to wield the power herself. That feels right, because Margaery’s done such a good job over the years of keeping up with Cersei. They’re pretty well-balanced.</p><p><strong>HBO: What’s running through her mind when she is dressing for the trial?</strong></p><p><strong>Natalie Dormer: </strong>It’s the most serious situation we’ve ever seen Margaery in. What I think I was able to play this season was her genuine concern and fear that she wasn’t going to get out of this situation. You see that in her fear for the lives and safety of her family – that’s why she sends Olenna away, and it’s why she appears to seem converted in a last-ditch attempt to save Loras’s life. Loras has been profoundly damaged, and now she’s trying to limit the damage as much as possible. Obviously she doesn’t think she’s going to die, but she’s not sure what is going to happen; I think there was a massive question mark over the whole day.</p><p><strong>HBO: What do you think about the terrible irony that she knew something was wrong right before the explosion?</strong></p><p><strong>Natalie Dormer: </strong>That’s the beauty of what Dan and David wrote. They gave her the privileged position of being the only person to realize what’s happening, a moment of vindication that just summed up her personality. She was always a couple of steps ahead of everyone else, even to her last moment. I’m very grateful, because Margaery Tyrell was never a victim – even in her last moment they allowed her to not be. It’s also very poignant that she’s standing there holding Loras, because her love and her closeness with her sibling has always been in the background. For Finn [Jones, who plays Loras] and I to go out together, literally holding on to each other, was a beautiful moment.</p><p><strong>HBO: How was your last day of shooting?</strong></p><p><strong>Natalie Dormer:</strong> My actual last day was with Diana Rigg [Olenna], where I hand her the bit of paper with the rose drawing. It was very fitting: the actor hugging the actor goodbye, and the character hugging the character. Dan and David were both there in order to give me the proper send-off. It was an emotional day.</p><p><strong>HBO: Did you take a souvenir from the set?</strong></p><p><strong>Natalie Dormer: </strong>They gave me Margaery’s wedding crown, with the roses interwoven around the Baratheon antlers which sits on my bookshelf and will be loved from now until the rest of my days.</p><p><strong>THINK FAST</strong></p><p><strong>HBO:</strong> <strong>If you were King, who would you choose for your Hand?</strong></p><p><strong>Natalie Dormer:</strong> It would have to be Tyrion Lannister, wouldn’t it?</p><p><strong>HBO: Which character would you choose to warg into?</strong></p><p><strong>Natalie Dormer: </strong>The Hound. I really do love Rory’s character, I think he’s been on such a cool trajectory, and I think there’s more to come. And it’d be nice to play the opposite of Margaery who’s sitting around in silk skirts – to be a big, bulking man in armor.</p><p><strong>HBO: Queen of the Seven Kingdoms: Cersei, Daenerys, or Sansa?</strong></p><p><strong>Natalie Dormer:</strong> Sansa’s amazing, and I’m really looking forward to see where she ends up, but probably Dany. That’s where I am at the end of Season 6, but hey, it changes!</p><h3>More From \"The Winds of Winter\"</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/bella-ramsey-lyanna-mormont\">Interview with Bella Ramsey, who plays Lyanna Mormont</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/heavy-is-the-crown-for-dean-charles-chapmans-tommen\">Interview with Dean-Charles Chapman, who plays Tommen</a></li><li><a href=\"https://order.hbonow.com/?camp=NOWS27_Game_of_Thrones\">Watch the behind-the-scenes docuseries <em>The Game Revealed</em>&nbsp;on HBO NOW</a></li></ul><p> </p><p></p>", vote_number: 0, title: "Natalie Dormer’s Margaery Tyrell Is No Victim", summary: "GoT costume designer Michele Clapton speaks about her new partnership with \njewelry brand Yunus & Eliza to create MEY Designs, and their new line of \naccessories worn or inspired by Daenerys Targaryen. "},

Bella Ramsey, the 12-year-old actor who portrays the formidable leader of Bear Island, chats for the first time about her role.</p><p><strong>HBO: What did you first think of Lyanna when you read the script?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Bella Ramsey:</strong> I thought, “This is a character to really get my teeth into.” Lyanna is strong about what she believes, and wants to keep her family and island protected; she wants to be treated like an adult. She's strong, and firm when she needs to be, and wants the best for her house and the North.</p><p><strong>HBO: Fans love Lyanna! What do you think about their reaction?</strong></p><p><strong>Bella Ramsey: </strong>It's crazy really. I didn't expect anything like it. I am very, very happy that people like Lyanna Mormont. We had to keep it quiet that I had a part in <em>GoT</em> so now it's out, my family have had lots of people they know contacting them, really excited they have seen me.</p><p><strong>HBO: Had you seen the show before filming your scenes?</strong></p><p><strong>Bella Ramsey:</strong> When I knew I got the part, I was allowed to watch a few suitable snippets. I was interested to see the bit in Season 5 when Stannis [Baratheon] received Lyanna's letter. &nbsp;</p>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/57716cda1b631bf0f301bf51/1467051233286/\" data-image-dimensions=\"1200x800\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"57716cda1b631bf0f301bf51\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/57716cda1b631bf0f301bf51/1467051233286/?format=1000w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n<p><strong>HBO: How do you approach your scenes?</strong></p><p><strong>Bella Ramsey:</strong> I read through the whole scene first, not necessarily focusing on my lines, but on the scene as a whole. I think it's important to have an understanding for it before I start approaching actually learning my lines.</p><p><strong>HBO: Did you realize how important your character was going to be?</strong></p><p><strong>Bella Ramsey:</strong> It took me a while to realize it. I actually woke up one morning and the first thing I thought was, “Wow, I really am integral to the storyline.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HBO: What was it like playing such a fierce character? Was that easy for you?</strong></p><p><strong>Bella Ramsey: </strong>It was good, really good, being fierce. It all kind of comes naturally when I become Lyanna because it's in her nature; it's just who she is. I loved the script for Episode 10 [\"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gameofthrones.com/game-of-thrones/season-6/episode-10\">The Winds of Winter</a>\"] – how she doesn't care that she is the youngest person in the room, and proceeds to shame the three leaders.</p><p><strong>HBO: Why do you think Ser Davos changed Lyanna’s mind about helping the Starks?</strong></p><p><strong>Bella Ramsey:</strong> I think Lyanna realized she was named after a Stark, and her house should be supporting them. Davos spoke to her as a leader of a house, rather than a child, which she was grateful for. He empathized with her, without babying her, which she respected. I think that influenced her decision.</p><p><strong>HBO: Did they tell you about the character you are named after?</strong></p><p><strong>Bella Ramsey:</strong> Not really. I knew that Lyanna was named after her, but that's all I needed to know, I think. Lyanna Mormont is very much her own person.</p><p><strong>HBO: What inspires Lyanna to declare Jon Snow her king? Why does she believe in him?</strong></p><p><strong>Bella Ramsey:</strong> She wants to get the other houses to follow him. She believes that Stark blood runs through his veins … and she believes he is the only one that can make a difference.</p><p><strong>HBO: How do you imagine life on Bear Island?</strong></p><p><strong>Bella Ramsey:</strong> I think it's pretty calm and relaxed, no stress, no rush. I think the food would be good and Lyanna would probably love the waterfall. It would be serene and peaceful. I'd like to live there!</p><p><strong>HBO: Which scene was your favorite to shoot?</strong></p><p><strong>Bella Ramsey:</strong> I loved them all, as it was my first experience of filming. I loved Episode 10, but the room we were filming in was like an overheated sauna, so probably Episode 7 [\"The Broken Man\"].

What’s the secret to a good costume? “If the people who are making it have a good idea of the details,” said <em>Game of Thrones</em> costume designer Michele Clapton. “It often doesn’t matter how well it’s made – it’s that the elements are there. It makes you really happy to see people try.”</p><p>Below are some tips from the experts on perfecting your character costumes.</p><h3><strong>Cersei Lannister</strong></h3><p>Clapton called the Queen on the Iron Throne the most challenging character to dress. “Her dress is very structured and there’s a lot of work that goes underneath it to support the shapes.” Despite the challenge, Clapton said she’d love to dress as the queen. “I’d love to get into the leather dress [from the finale].”</p><h3><strong>Hodor</strong></h3><p>“The key is dirt,” actor Kristian Nairn said of dressing up like Hodor. Your costume “has to be horribly hot and uncomfortable. It needs to smell bad.&nbsp;You need to have a child who is really a man strapped to your back. Sweat a lot in the San Diego sun and I’ll be there with you.\"</p><h3><strong>Bran Stark</strong></h3><p>Isaac Hempstead Wright described Bran as having “this skirt thing going on.”&nbsp; The key ingredients are “a nice skirt, leather tunic and then some nice Italian leather boots.” If all else fails: “Maybe just come as a tree.”</p><h3><strong>Missandei</strong></h3><p>“The fro needs to be on point,” Nathalie Emmanuel said about imitating Missandei. “Learn how to do a good braid or have a friend do a good braid for you. Buy a lot of blue stuff and some crop tops.”</p><h3><strong>Sansa Stark</strong></h3><p>Sophie Turner recommended getting into character: “You need to have a sad face on. You need to be crying, otherwise you’re not Sansa.”</p><h3><strong>Samwell Tarly</strong></h3><p>Actor John Bradley had specific advice for fans looking to dress as Sam: “Don’t. I’ve had that costume in all various extreme weather conditions; snow in Iceland, rain in Belfast, sunshine in Spain. It’s never effective anywhere. No matter where you go with it, it’s a burden. So my advice is to not dress like Sam at all.”</p><p>Below are a few fans in San Diego who perfected their GoT looks.</p>\n  \n    \n      \n\n        \n          \n            \n              \n

  {image: nil, content: "<p>Now that winter has arrived, the cast and creators of <em>Game of Thrones</em> had much to discuss at the San Diego Comic-Con panel. Attendees included executive producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, director Miguel Sapochnik and actors Liam Cunningham (Davos Seaworth), John Bradley-West (Samwell Tarly), Nathalie Emmanuel (Missandei), Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark), Conleth Hill (Varys), Faye Marsay (the Waif), Kristian Nairn (Hodor), Iwan Rheon (Ramsay Bolton) and Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark). <em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em>’s Rob McElhenney moderated.</p><p>Check out 13 topics of conversation below.</p><h3><strong>1.&nbsp;Season 7 Production</strong></h3><p>Moderator Rob McElhenney kicked things off with a question for the series creators –&nbsp;“Why do you hate us all so much?” – alluding to the summer premiere date of Season 7, which will contain seven episodes instead of the traditional 10. “Winter is here,” Benioff quoted, and explained the schedule: “We shoot where there are places with trees. We have to wait for the leaves to fall off.” Weiss had advice for how to cope with the shorter season: “Rewatch. Start over at the beginning”</p><h3><strong>2. The Book/Show Relationship</strong></h3><p>“Hopefully we’re still living out the spirit of [author] George [RR Martin]’s imagination,” said Benioff. “Even though we’re beyond the books, one thing that’s fun is that though George’s books will be very different in some respects and the same in others.&nbsp;Hopefully both the series and the books will be surprising.”</p><h3><strong>3. Ramsay’s Motivations</strong></h3><p>“What is it like to be America’s sweetheart?” McElhenney asked the man behind Ramsay Bolton. Rheon maintained that Ramsay was a great villain because “he had this kind of joy in everything that he does. He was having the best time of his life.” When McElhenney asked about Ramsay's perspective, Rheon replied sympathetically. “The poor guy’s had a tough upbringing. He’s looking for his father’s love and acceptance and recognition all his life.” Sophie Turner chimed in: “Boo hoo.”&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>4. Ramsay’s Death</strong></h3><p>When Turner was asked which Season 6 scene she was most excited to film, she didn’t hesitate: “100% Ramsay's death scene. The past five seasons have been building up to this – her first kill.... Someone actually quoted that scene to me in a park the other day: 'Your house will disappear. Your family will disappear.' I forgot it was from the show and thought they were cursing me. But I love the way it was written, it was wonderful.” Actor Iwan Rheon turned to Turner, adding: “It was an honor to be killed by you.”</p>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"thumb-image\" data-image=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/5792cf7ad1758ec97e77a9b4/1469239171224/\" data-image-dimensions=\"940x545\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5792cf7ad1758ec97e77a9b4\" data-type=\"image\" src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fc05c9e4b08fc45bd99090/t/5792cf7ad1758ec97e77a9b4/1469239171224/?format=1000w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n<h3><strong>5. Hodor’s Origin</strong></h3><p>“Three or four years ago, we were talking to George in Santa Fe,\" Benioff recalled.&nbsp;\"He told where he was heading in the books – and Hodor’s fate.&nbsp;We were so amazed and excited.” Actor Kristian Nairn was awed by fans' reaction: “The scene was incredibly written and directed and I knew it was going to be cool,” said Nairn, “but I didn’t expect the outpouring of emotions.” The crowd audibly sighed, prompting Nairn to get emotional: “You’re going to make me cry!”</p><h3><strong>6. Traumatic Viewing</strong></h3><p>“These guys keep taking the people I like working with away from me,” said Liam Cunningham of Benioff and Weiss. Cunningham admitted he was shocked to learn of Shireen's death: “You would have heard the clang of my jaw when I read it.” The sadness continued when the actor gave the carved stag to his real-life daughter and encouraged her to watch the episode with the token – unaware of the scene that awaited her. “My daughter was a heap on the sofa watching my surrogate daughter getting burned to death while she held the stag that I had stolen. I felt like the worse dad in the world.”</p><h3><strong>7. Theoretical Deaths</strong></h3><p>McElhenney reasoned that Samwell Tarly’s sweetness makes him prime to die. He asked actor John Bradley-West how he’d like Sam to go out. Bradley-West described Samwell climbing the library shelves to reach a tome when things go awry. “He severely underestimates his own weight and falls backwards off the bookshelf.&nbsp;Imagine the poetic justice. It wasn’t battle that killed him – it was books that killed him.”</p><h3><strong>8. A Girl-Power Dream Team</strong></h3><p>When asked about the future of Missandei, Emmanuel was enthusiastic:&nbsp;“She genuinely believes in Daenerys and her claim. These two women respect and lift each other up. It’s a really sweet friendship and working relationship as well. I hope they continue to be a girl-power couple.”</p><h3><strong>9. Historical Inspirations</strong></h3><p>“The books are built on a skeleton of Medieval Western history,” said Weiss, “But one of the great things about fantasy is you’re not bound to what happened.” Director Miguel Sapochnik explained that the Battle of the Bastards was “steeped in history.” The fight was initially based on the Battle of Agincourt and became informed by the Battle of Cannae – especially the pile of bodies. “It was the first imagine in my head when I read the outline,” Sapochnik said, explaining that the art department shifted around 257 bodies from shot to shot to create a sense of scale.</p><h3><strong>10. Stark Sibling Rivalry</strong></h3><p>“Why didn’t Sansa tell Jon about the Knights of the Vale?” asked McElhenney. Turner’s answer: “She wanted all the credit and it was a more dramatic moment when they showed up.” The tension goes beyond battle in Turner’s mind: “I’m not sure that she believes that Jon is capable of running Winterfell and the North. She doesn’t think that Jon has the intellect, knowledge and experience that she has. I concur.” Turner acknowledged Jon's good morals but questioned if his decisions would benefit the greater good, adding, “Whatever, Jon.”</p><h3><strong>11. Is a Girl Arya?</strong></h3><p>Faye Marsay addressed the popular fan theory that Arya and the Waif are the same person. “The theory was a cool one,\" Marsay said, “but I think Arya is Arya and that’s her journey. The writers got it right.” McElhenney turned to Benioff and Weiss for confirmation, but the two remained stone-faced.</p><h3><strong>12. The Tower of Joy Reveal</strong></h3><p>What will Bran do after learning of Jon Snow’s true parentage? “Bran knows he’s been shown this information for a reason,” Isaac Hempstead Wright explained. “I presume somehow he’ll tell Jon. I don’t know how Jon will take it when Bran turns up and says: ‘By the way, I’m a tree wizard and your dad isn’t your dad.’ “</p><h3><strong>13. Picks for the Iron Throne</strong></h3><p>The group went down the line and revealed who they hoped would sit on the Iron Throne. Cunningham had a dark selection: “I see the Night King with his leg over the arm smoking on a Cuban cigar.” Sophie Turner also had an unlikely choice: Littlefinger. Her selection yielded cries of “Shame” from McElhenney. “It’d be fun, quirky and sadistic,” she reasoned. Hempstead Wright chose a “four-pronged Stark dream team with Bran sitting in the corner with a tree.” Iwan Rheon had other ideas: “Melt the thing down and have a democracy.”</p><h3> </h3><p> </p><p> </p><p></p>", vote_number: 0, title: "13 Talking Points From the Game of Thrones Panel at SDCC", summary: "Now that winter has arrived, the cast and creators of Game of Thrones had \nmuch to discuss with moderator Rob McElhenney at San Diego Comic-Con.

It must be hard for them to break down how someone is going to die on the show, but they were really nice. They didn’t give away too much. At first I was gutted, but more than anything, I was just happy to be a part of such an amazing show.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HBO: Tommen’s death is eerily quiet. How did you approach filming the scene?</strong></p><p><strong>Dean-Charles Chapman: </strong>We tried a few different versions. The one that made the edit was more shell shock instead of Tommen bawling his eyes out and feeling sadness, anger or revenge. His number one priority – his wife – was in that Sept. He knows that it is game over for him. I think taking off the crown is Tommen giving up.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HBO: Were you surprised about the twist at Cersei’s trial?</strong></p><p><strong>Dean-Charles Chapman:</strong> I was really shocked. I think Tommen knew his mom was trying to figure a way out, but I don’t think he imagined that it was going to go down like that. I don’t think he imagined for two seconds that Margaery was going to die. No way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HBO: Leading into the trial, did Tommen’s loyalty lie with Margaery or Cersei?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Dean-Charles Chapman: </strong>Tommen literally gets manipulated by everyone, but I think his main loyalty was with both Cersei <em>and</em> Margaery. He loves his mom to pieces, but on the other hand, Margaery’s his wife – she’s gorgeous and he loves her. He can’t choose between them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HBO: Was Tommen truly indoctrinated by the High Sparrow?</strong><br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Dean-Charles Chapman:</strong> At the start of the relationship, Tommen knows that the High Sparrow isn’t someone he should trust. But as I said, Tommen gets manipulated by everyone, so unfortunately he gets wrapped around the High Sparrow’s finger. I don’t think he necessarily likes the High Sparrow, but he assumes that if he goes along with what the High Sparrow says, everything will resolve happily. There’ll be no more death or blood and everyone can just get along. If you can’t beat them, then you might as well join them.</p><p><strong>HBO: How do you think Tommen stacks up to Joffrey as a king?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Dean-Charles Chapman: </strong>Even though they’re brothers, they’re complete opposites. Joffrey was a psychopathic maniac. Ruling and power got to his head. He threw his weight around. Tommen is the opposite. I don’t necessarily believe that he wants to be king – he doesn’t have a clue about politics or know what he’s doing. He’s just a puppet for anyone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HBO: Do you think Cersei has the makings of a good queen?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Dean-Charles Chapman: </strong>I think she’ll be a strong queen, maybe a bit too strong. It will be interesting to see how she plays out now that she’s lost all her children.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HBO: Do you have a favorite scene from your time on <em>Game of Thrones</em>?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Dean-Charles Chapman:</strong> I’d probably choose the Ser Pounce scene in “Oathkeeper.” That was my first day, so that meant a lot to me. It’s an iconic scene for Tommen with Ser Pounce and Margaery. It was a long, hard day, because the cat was a bit of a diva.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HBO: Is there anything you wish you had the chance to do as Tommen?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Dean-Charles Chapman:</strong> Yeah. I really wanted Tommen to stab someone. Maybe if Tommen had done battle in the Sept, he’d have killed the High Sparrow. I’ve never killed someone in a show or film, so that’s on my list. It would have been pretty cool to do on <em>Game of Thrones</em>.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>THINK FAST </strong></h3><p><strong>HBO: What became of Ser Pounce?</strong></p><p><strong>Dean-Charles Chapman:</strong> He probably got a girlfriend and got married… And probably got caught up in the Sept blast, unfortunately.</p><p><strong>HBO: Who’s your favorite Lannister?</strong></p><p><strong>Dean-Charles Chapman: </strong>Jaime Lannister. In the first few seasons, I thought he was a bit of a “bleep-word.” [<em>Laughs</em>] But in Season 3, you start to see a soft, more-human side. I think he would make a good ruler.</p><p><strong>HBO: What would be your ideal next project?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Dean-Charles Chapman: </strong>I like a good old thriller.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HBO: Who would you put on the throne as your heir?</strong></p><p><strong>Dean-Charles Chapman:</strong> Jaime Lannister.&nbsp;</p><h3>MORE FROM \"THE WINDS OF WINTER\"</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/bella-ramsey-lyanna-mormont\">Interview with Bella Ramsey, who plays Lyanna Mormont</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/natalie-dormer-margaery-tyrell-interview\">Interview with Natalie Dormer, who plays Margaery Tyrell</a></li><li><a href=\"https://order.hbonow.com/?camp=NOWS27_Game_of_Thrones\">Watch behind-the-scenes docuseries <em>The Game Revealed</em></a>&nbsp;on HBO NOW</li></ul>", vote_number: 0, title: "Heavy Is the Crown for Dean-Charles Chapman’s Tommen ", summary: "GoT relationships are complicated, as this diagram proves.
